# Nebula Crawler

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A libp2p DHT crawler that gathers information about the network. Starting with a set of bootstrap nodes it recursively asks all nodes in the network for their DHT entries. Gathered information contains the agent version distribution or dialable/undialable peer ratio
